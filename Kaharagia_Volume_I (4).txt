XI. EXPANDED SECTION: THE SOVEREIGN (DETAILED)
---------------------------------------------------------------
1. Constitutional Character of the Sovereign
The Sovereign functions as the enduring symbol and legal embodiment of the
Principality of Kaharagia. While the Principality currently lacks territorial
jurisdiction, the Sovereign nevertheless exercises supreme constitutional
authority derived from the collective identity, will, and cultural continuity
of the Kaharagian nation.

The Sovereign’s legitimacy arises from:
