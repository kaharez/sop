# LII. DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE & CYBER GOVERNANCE

## 1. Purpose
To protect the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of all government
information systems, ensuring resilience and continuity.

## 2. Core Infrastructure Standards

### A. Zero-Trust Architecture
No user, device, or system is trusted by default.

### B. Encryption
All sensitive data must be encrypted at rest and in transit.

### C. Access Control

## Systems must enforce
- role-based access control (RBAC),
- least-privilege principles,
- multi-factor authentication.

## 3. Monitoring and Incident Response

### A. System Monitoring
Continuous monitoring for anomalies, intrusion attempts, and unusual activity.

### B. Incident Response Procedures
- detection,
- containment,
- eradication,
- recovery,
- review and reporting.

## 4. Backups and Redundancy

### A. Backups must be:
- frequent,
- verified,
- stored in multiple secure locations.

### B. Redundant Infrastructure
Critical systems must exist in parallel forms to ensure continuity.

## 5. Cyber Governance Responsibilities
- **Office of Digital Government oversees standards,**
- Secretariat of State ensures compliance,
- National Archives ensures preservation of digital records.

## 6. Configuration and asset management
- Maintain an authoritative inventory of systems, services, and data flows.
- Enforce hardened baselines, patch management schedules, and change control
  with rollback plans.

## 7. Third-party risk
- Vet vendors for security posture; require contractual controls (encryption,
  audit rights, breach notification, data location).
- Monitor external dependencies and revoke access promptly when no longer
  necessary.

## 8. Testing and drills
- Conduct regular penetration tests, tabletop exercises, and disaster recovery
  drills; track findings to closure.
- Validate restore-from-backup procedures for critical services.

## 9. Logging and monitoring
- Centralise logs with retention aligned to data governance; protect logs from
  tampering.
- Define alerting thresholds and incident classification to trigger response
  procedures.
