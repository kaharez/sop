# XLVI. LEGAL DRAFTING STANDARDS

## 1. Purpose of Legal Drafting Standards
The purpose of standardised legal drafting is to ensure clarity, consistency,
predictability, and accessibility in all instruments issued by the Sovereign,
the Secretariat of State, or authorised offices. These standards promote legal
certainty and facilitate future revision, interpretation, and codification.

## 2. Fundamental Principles
### A. Plain, Precise Language
Legal texts must avoid unnecessary complexity. Every clause must be clear,
unambiguous, and logically structured.

### B. Internal Consistency
Terms must be used consistently throughout a document and across the broader
body of Kaharagian law.

### C. Authority Statements
Every legal instrument must specify the legal authority under which it is issued.

### D. Amendability and Durability
Legislation must be structured so future amendments, repeals, or consolidations
can be performed without confusion.

## 3. Required Structure of a Legal Instrument
### A. Title
Reflects the subject, year, and purpose.

### B. Numbering
Assigned by the Royal Chancellery in sequential order.

### C. Authority Clause
States which legal or royal authority authorises its issuance.

### D. Enacting Clause
Introduces the operative provisions.

### E. Definitions Section
Defines key terms to avoid misinterpretation.

### F. Substantive Provisions
Divided into Parts, Sections, and Subsections as needed.

### G. Implementation Clause
Specifies how and when the law takes effect.

### H. Repeal or Amendment Clauses
Indicate which prior instruments are affected.

### I. Signature and Seal

- **Must include:**
- **Sovereign’s signature**
- **Authentication by the Clerk of the Royal Chancellery**
- **Great Seal affixed**

## 4. Drafting Format
- Use formal British English.
- Use numbered subsections for clarity.
- Avoid passive voice when a subject of authority is identifiable.
- Include schedules for lists, technical standards, or transitional provisions.

## 5. References and Citations

- **When referencing other legal instruments:**
- Use full citation format: **“Royal Decree No. [Number]/[Year]”**.
- For treaties: include **title, date, and parties**.

## 6. Amendments

- **Amendments must specify:**
- the exact text to be replaced,
- the new text,
- whether changes are temporary or permanent.

## 7. Quality and Review Controls
- Each draft must include **authority references**, **cross-references**, and a
  **change log** summarising major provisions.
- Plain-language summaries accompany instruments for Gazette publication where
  appropriate (does not replace the authoritative text).
- Legal review by the Office of Laws & Justice is mandatory before Chancellery
  submission; Protocol reviews ceremonial or honours content when applicable.

## 8. Versioning and Numbering
- Drafts carry working numbers; final numbers are assigned by the Royal
  Chancellery upon registration.
- Superseded instruments are clearly marked with repeal/amendment references;
  consolidated tables are maintained for transparency.

## 9. Templates and Schedules
- Use the official templates (see Section XXXVI) for decrees, warrants,
  gazette notices, and diplomatic notes.
- Place technical details or lists in schedules for easier future amendment
  without altering core clauses.
