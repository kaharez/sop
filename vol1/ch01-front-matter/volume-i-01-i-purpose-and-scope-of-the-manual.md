# I. PURPOSE AND SCOPE OF THE MANUAL

This Manual establishes the structure, roles, functions, and procedures of the
Sovereign, the Royal Court, and the Secretariat of State of the Principality
of Kaharagia. It is intended as an authoritative guide for officials, members
of the Royal Court, directors of government offices, and citizens seeking an
understanding of the national institutions that guide the Kaharagian people.

- **The Manual serves four primary purposes:**

## 1. To codify the constitutional and ceremonial roles of the Sovereign.

## 2. To define the composition and functioning of the Royal Court.

## 3. To outline the leadership and internal structure of the Secretariat of State.

## 4. To specify documentary, ceremonial, heraldic, and honours procedures.

and is binding upon all bodies subordinate to the Secretariat of State unless
otherwise directed by Royal Decree.

  requires written approval and Gazette publication where relevant.

- **Maintenance and updates:**
- Reviewed at least annually by the Secretary of State; urgent amendments may
  be issued by Royal Decree at any time.
