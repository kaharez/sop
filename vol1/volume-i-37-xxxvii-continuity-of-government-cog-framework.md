# XXXVII. CONTINUITY OF GOVERNMENT (COG) FRAMEWORK

### 1. Purpose
The Continuity of Government Framework ensures the stability and legitimacy
of governance during emergencies, transitional periods, digital disruption,
or unexpected incapacitation of key officials.

### 2. Principles of Continuity

#### A. Uninterrupted Sovereign Legitimacy
The Sovereign’s authority continues regardless of disruption to administrative
structures.

#### B. Documentation Integrity

### All legal instruments must be
- preserved,
- backed up,
- maintained with cryptographic confirmation.

#### C. Chain of Administrative Authority

### 1. Sovereign

### 2. Secretary of State

### 3. Deputy Secretaries of State

### 4. Assistant Secretary of State

### 5. Undersecretaries of State

### 6. Directors

#### D. Emergency Activation

### Continuity measures activate when
- communication channels fail,
- digital systems are compromised,
- key officials are unavailable,
- extraordinary crises occur.

### 3. Digital Continuity

#### A. Redundant systems
All vital records must exist in multiple secure locations.

#### B. Offline Authority
If digital systems fail, the Royal Chancellery may issue temporary
continuity instruments based on authenticated physical or alternative
communication methods.

#### C. Cryptographic Verification

### All digital acts must be tied to secure keys held by
- Secretariat of State,
- Royal Chancellery,
- Digital Government Office.

### 4. Activation protocols
- Triggers: invoked by the Secretary of State (or Assistant Secretary if the
  Secretary is unavailable) upon confirmed outage/incapacity or directed by the
  Sovereign.
- Documentation: issue a continuity notice (Gazette or fallback channel) stating
  scope, duration, and interim signatories.
- Verification: use pre-distributed offline key material and seal kits to
  authenticate urgent acts until normal systems are restored.

### 5. Reconstitution
- Prioritise restoration of communications, identity systems, and Gazette
  publication; validate data integrity via hash comparisons and backups.
- Review all continuity-period acts; ratify or reissue under the Great Seal as
  needed.
- Record a post-incident report with timeline, decisions, and corrective
  actions; publish a summary for transparency where security permits.
