# XLVII. INTERGOVERNMENTAL & INTERAGENCY COORDINATION

### 1. Purpose
Effective governance relies on coordinated action across Offices, Agencies,
and Sections within the Secretariat of State.

### 2. Coordination Mechanisms

#### A. Interoffice Committees

### Chaired by the Secretary or Deputy Secretary of State for major issues such as
- cybersecurity
- national identity systems
- diplomatic strategy
- cultural preservation

#### B. Joint Tasking Orders
Issued when multiple Offices must execute parts of a single initiative.

#### C. Shared Reports

### Offices must share
- monthly activity summaries
- incident briefings
- policy impact assessments

### 3. Lead Office Principle

### When multiple Offices share responsibility
- one Office is designated as the Lead Office
- other Offices support under joint planning
- the Lead Office coordinates timelines and outputs

### 4. Coordination with the Royal Court

### The Secretariat of State must consult the Royal Court on
- ceremonial matters
- honours and awards
- heraldic or symbolic decisions
- publication of certain instruments
- cultural diplomatic functions

### 5. Shared Databases and Information Systems

#### A. Identity & Citizenship Registry
Managed by the Office of Citizenship and Identity.

#### B. Gazette Publication Archive

### Jointly used by
- Royal Chancellery
- **Office of Government Communications**
- National Archives

#### C. International Affairs Repository
Maintained by the Office of Foreign Affairs.

### 6. Cadence and governance
- Committees meet at defined intervals; minutes capture decisions, owners, and
  deadlines and are filed with the Royal Chancellery.
- Joint tasking orders specify lead/support Offices, deliverables, and review
  points; status is tracked until completion.

### 7. Dispute resolution
- Conflicts between Offices escalate to the Assistant Secretary of State, then
  to the Secretary if unresolved; outcomes are recorded with rationale.

### 8. Information sharing and security
- Shared systems must apply common access controls, classification, and audit
  logging; data sharing agreements define permissible use and retention.
- Sensitive data exchanges (identity, security, honours) require encryption
  and need-to-know access enforced by Digital Government.
