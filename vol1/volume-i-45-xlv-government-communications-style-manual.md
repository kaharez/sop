## 5. Official Statements by the Sovereign

## Require
- approval through the Secretariat of State,
- review by the Royal Chancellery,
- publication in the Gazette.

## 6. Digital Communications

## All online publications must
- use accessible formatting,
- follow consolidation standards,
- retain permanent URLs for archival purposes.

## 7. Visual and brand standards
- Use approved wordmarks, seals, and colour palettes from the Institute of
  Heraldry; no substitutions without approval.
- Ensure imagery reflects dignity and inclusivity; avoid clutter and effects
  that impair readability.

## 8. Approval pathways
- Statements, releases, and web updates require review by Government
  Communications; legal or protocol-sensitive items also require Office of
  Laws & Justice or Protocol clearance.
- Urgent releases follow the crisis communication playbook with timestamped
  approvals.

## 9. Corrections and retractions
- Errors are corrected promptly with clear labels and updated timestamps; the
  Gazette carries errata where legal instruments are affected.
- Archived versions are retained to preserve transparency and audit trails.
