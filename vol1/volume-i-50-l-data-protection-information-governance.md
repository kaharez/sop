  Defence Policy; containment, investigation, and notification steps are logged.

  appropriate, for public transparency via Government Communications.

### 9. Third-party and cross-border considerations
- External processors or platforms must sign data protection agreements
  enforcing equivalent safeguards, audit rights, and breach notification.
- Cross-border transfers (if any) require risk assessment, legal basis, and
  documented approval.

### 10. Data subject rights (where applicable)
- Requests for access, correction, or revocation are processed through
  defined workflows with identity verification and audit trails.
- Denials (e.g., for security or legal exemptions) are documented with reasons
  and retention of request records.
