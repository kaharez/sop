# VI. SECRETARIAT OF STATE — STRUCTURE AND LEADERSHIP

## 1. Secretary of State
The head of government operations; coordinates all Sections and Offices.

## 2. Assistant Secretary of State
Supports daily functioning and continuity of governance.

## 3. Sections and Undersecretaries

- **The Secretariat operates through three Sections:**
- Section for General Affairs & National Administration
- Section for External Relations & International Presence
- Section for Cultural, Academic & Digital Nation-Building

Each Section is led by an Undersecretary of State.

## 4. Core leadership functions
- Strategic direction: sets national priorities, allocates resources, and
  translates Sovereign guidance into actionable programmes.
- Procedural oversight: ensures every instrument, publication, and ceremonial
  act follows approved formats, numbering, and security controls.
- Inter-Section coordination: convenes weekly coordination sessions across
  Undersecretaries to resolve dependencies, share risks, and align timelines.
- Performance accountability: receives quarterly reports from Directors and
  Undersecretaries; issues corrective instructions where targets or standards
  are missed.

## 5. Assistant Secretary of State — continuity remit
- Keeps the Secretariat operating during leadership transitions or absences,
  activating continuity protocols when needed.
- Screens submissions to the Secretary of State for completeness, legal review,
  and publication readiness.
- Maintains cross-Section issue logs and deadlines; escalates blockers.

## 6. Reporting and governance cadence
- Weekly: Section coordination chaired by the Secretary or Assistant Secretary.
- Monthly: Directorate performance review; risks logged with mitigation plans.
- Quarterly: Compliance and archival review with the Royal Chancellery and
  Office of Laws & Justice to confirm publication integrity.
- Annual: Strategic review and update of this Manual; results published in the
  Gazette for transparency.

## 7. Digital and security posture
- All leadership submissions use authenticated channels approved by the Office
  of Digital Government & Cybersecurity.
- Sensitive instruments (treaties, honours, identity) require two-person
  integrity checks before Sovereign signature and Gazette release.
