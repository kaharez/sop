# LXV. FINAL CONSOLIDATED PRINCIPLES OF GOVERNANCE

1. Organising Principles
The Principality functions on core principles:
- dignity,
- legitimacy,
- continuity,
- transparency,
- professionalism,
- stewardship.

2. Administrative Integrity
Every office and official must uphold:
- lawful conduct,
- proper documentation,
- confidentiality where required,
- accuracy in communication.

3. Role of the Sovereign
The Sovereign remains the embodiment of unity and continuity. Governance flows
from the Sovereign’s authority but is carried out through structured,
professional administration.

4. Role of the Secretariat of State
The Secretariat ensures:
- coordination,
- execution of policies,
- record keeping,
- communication,
- preservation of institutional memory.

5. The Importance of Identity
As a non‑territorial state, identity is the foundation of governance. Every
ceremony, document, and interaction reinforces the cultural and institutional
existence of the Principality.

6. Accountability and transparency
- Decisions are documented, authenticated, and, where appropriate, published in
  the Gazette to maintain public trust.
- Ethical standards, data protection, and protocol compliance are enforced and
  audited regularly.

7. Resilience and continuity
- Continuity plans, secure digital infrastructure, and strong archival
  practices ensure legitimacy persists through crises.
- Succession and delegation are clearly defined to prevent gaps in authority.

8. Public service ethos
- Officials serve with impartiality, courtesy, and professionalism, providing
  accessible services and clear information.
- Recognition of service (honours, commendations) reinforces commitment to the
  mission of the Principality.
