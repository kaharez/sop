XI. EXPANDED SECTION: THE SOVEREIGN (DETAILED)
---------------------------------------------------------------
1. Constitutional Character of the Sovereign
The Sovereign functions as the enduring symbol and legal embodiment of the
Principality of Kaharagia. While the Principality currently lacks territorial
jurisdiction, the Sovereign nevertheless exercises supreme constitutional
authority derived from the collective identity, will, and cultural continuity
of the Kaharagian nation.

The Sovereign’s legitimacy arises from:
- The historical continuity of the Kaharagian national ideal.
- The recognition of the Sovereign as guardian of national unity.

The Sovereign’s authority is therefore declarative (in defining national
identity and legitimacy), constitutive (in establishing institutions and norms),
and administrative (in approving the acts of government).

A. Legal Authority  
Through the signing of Decrees, Letters Patent, and Charters, the Sovereign
creates binding legal norms that govern the Principality’s structures.

The Sovereign presides over ceremonies, investitures, state observances,
